# Project3
This project is for a backend sql application to represent the CRUD functionality of an SQL database

The project is running on the main branch in GitHub.

The database I am using is SQL and the GUI is MySQL WorkBench.

The database comprises of three model tables - Users, Bookings, Reviews
The object of the database is to hold information for users utilizing an accommodation website.  The application provides three options of accommodation,  and a reviews page where customers can leave their feedback having completed their stay.

The website has a login/sign up button for those who would like to book accommodation through the site.  Users can access this on the NavBar , or when they are wanting to place a booking for one of the three accommodation offerings, the Book button will open up the Login/Sign up window firstn to register.  Once this is complete the user will return to the bookings page.  Here the user can select their accommodation choice and the dates of their stay.  

The reviews page is where previously registered users can log back in and leave a review. this table links to the both the booking and user table through a foreign key.
